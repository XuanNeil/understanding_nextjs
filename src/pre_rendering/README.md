Pre-rendering là gì? 
    - Two forms of pre-rendering.
        + SSG: Static Site Generation
        + SSR: Server Side Rendering

1. Static Site Generation.
    - The HTML is generated at build-time and is reused for each request.

2. Server Side Rendering.

    - The HTML is generated on each request.
   
3. Client Side Rendering.
    - Static generation without Data + Fetch Data on the Client-Side.
4. Incremental Static Regeneration. 


- When should I use Static Generation.
  1. Marketing pages
  2. Blog posts
  3. E-commerce product listings
  4. Help and documentation.

-Static HTML + JSON Data: getStaticProps
